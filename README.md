# Financial Models 💸📊

This repository contains a collection of financial algorithms for analyzing, forecasting, and valuing various business scenarios. The algorithms are built to assist in predicting prices and visualization with wavelet decomposition yeah i used wavelet decomposition for technical analysis and i am first to do so. It includes tools for creating projections, performing sensitivity analysis, and conducting scenario-based evaluations.

I lost all my crypto assets 🥲 Day trading in F&O, so I’m making these algorithms open-source, no more gatekeeping! Many scripts and projects were incomplete, hehe 😅

## How these models work?
These models respect Efficient Market Hypothesis so were not predicting when the change is coming rather were detecting if the change is happening now 


Raw Data -----> wavelet decompostion ----> Ray tracing to run monte carlo simulations ----> Deep learning Model + HMM ----> DQN model ----> probablity of 1% change under next 10 seconds

## Features ✨
